class ProjectedEEC:
  '''
  Wrapper class for c++ backend computing energy-energy correlators (EECs) 
  Correlators of higher order than 2 are project onto the longest side of the N-simplex

  Recommended usage is to construct with at least one axis, in which case 
  a boost_histogram object is used to bin the correlators in dR, and optionally
  any other variables you care to pass.

  If you are binning with respect to additional variables, just pass them 
  to __call__() in the same order as you listed their axes. They will 
  automagically be broadcasted to the right shapes and filled into the histogram

  If you are binning, addition and multiplication have been overloaded to 
  allow sensible addition of two ProjectedEEC objects and multiplication 
  by scalars

  If axes is None, this wrapper will instead store the dR and weight arrays
  with no binning. The overloaded arithmetic operators may not behave properly 
  in this case.

  Examples:

  #bin only with respect to dR:
  eec = ProjectedEEC(3, axes = [bh.axis.Regular(bins=75, start=1e-5, stop=1.0, transform=bh.axis.transform.log)])
  eec(particles, jets)
  print(eec.hist)

  #bin also with respect to jet pT and eta:
  eec = ProjectedEEC(3, axes = [bh.axis.Regular(bins=75, start=1e-5, stop=1.0, transform=bh.axis.transform.log), bh.axis.Regular(bins=10, start=10, end=500), bh.axis.Regular(bins=10, start=-5, end=5)])
  eec(particles, jets, jets.pt, jets.eta)
