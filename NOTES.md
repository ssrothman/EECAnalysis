# Thoughts
 - How should we apply JECs to our custom-clustered jets?
 - How should JECs be propegated to jet constituents? 
 - Should we include leptons in EECs?
 - How should we propegate finite energy resolution?
 - How should we propegate finite angular resolution?
 - How should we propegate event weights and their uncertainties?
 - Should we handle charged particles separately from neutrals (better angular res)?

# TODO
 - Need to check N=3 EECs in detail to find problem; maybe somewhere in the combinatorics?
 - Don't need to actually compute the peak at zero I think
 - Need to profile and optimize EEC computation
